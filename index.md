My name is Alexander Sosnkowski and I am a rising fourth year student at UVA with an interest in Cyber Security, Machine Learning, and the beauty of computer science. I have been lucky enough to work as a teacher assistant for many of the classes I love (Intro to Cybersecurity, Discrete Math and Theory 2, ect.) and I always enjoy discovering new solutions to historical problems or clever intuitions for difficult concepts. This website chronicles a few of my personnel projects!
